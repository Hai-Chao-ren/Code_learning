Iâ€™ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\\\nTypes of Memory#\\\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\\\n\\\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\', metadata={\\'description\\': \\'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\\\n\\\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agentsâ€™ experience in natural language.\\\\n\\\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agentâ€™s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\\\n\\\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agentâ€™s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\\\n\\\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.
